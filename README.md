# album-review-app
A simple app to track the new albums I listen to, write reviews, and discover new music across multiple languages and genres.

## About

  - See reviews (if available) and ratings.
  - Edit or delete albums.
  - Add album reviews if none exist.

  - Option to include Spotify links.
